    <h3>
      I have just recently returned from serving a mission for my church and
      Over the last couple months since then I've been learning more about code
      and webdevelopment. It has been a fun experiance learning and I've had
      some great teacher to help me along the way. I'm still learning and I'm
      excited to progress as I continue to learn.
